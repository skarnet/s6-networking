<h1> The <tt>s6-tcpserver-socketbinder</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-tcpserver-socketbinder</tt> binds an INET domain
socket to an IPv4 or IPv6 address and port, then executes a program.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-tcpserver-socketbinder [ -d | -D ] [ -b <em>backlog</em> ] [ -M | -m ] [ -B ] <em>ip</em> <em>port</em> <em>prog...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-tcpserver-socketbinder creates a TCP socket
and binds it to IP address <em>ip</em>, port <em>port</em>.
It prepares the socket to accept connections by calling
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/listen.html">listen()</a>. </li>
 <li> It then execs into <em>prog...</em> with the open socket
as its standard input. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-d</tt>&nbsp;: allow instant rebinding to the same IP and port
even if it has been used not long ago - this is the SO_REUSEADDR flag to
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/setsockopt.html">setsockopt()</a>
and is generally used with server programs. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-D</tt>&nbsp;: disallow instant rebinding to the same path. </li>
 <li> <tt>-b&nbsp;<em>backlog</em></tt>&nbsp;: set a maximum of
<em>backlog</em> backlog connections on the socket - extra
connection attempts will rejected by the kernel. The default is the maximum
number allowed by the system. If <em>backlog</em>
is 0, then the socket will be created, but it <strong>will not be
listening</strong>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-M</tt>&nbsp;: create a TCP socket. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-m</tt>&nbsp;: create a UDP socket. Note
that by default UDP sockets are not connection-mode, and <tt>listen()</tt>
will fail - so you should always give the <tt>-b0</tt> option to
s6-tcpserver-socketbinder along with <tt>-m</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-B</tt>&nbsp;: create a blocking socket. Default is non-blocking. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> The socket is provided <strong>non-blocking by default</strong>. </li>
 <li> s6-tcpserver-socketbinder is part of a set of basic blocks used to
build a flexible TCP/IP super-server. It normally should be given a
command line crafted to make it execute into
<a href="s6-tcpserverd.html">s6-tcpserverd</a> to accept connections
from clients, or into a program such as
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-applyuidgid.html">s6-applyuidgid</a>
to drop privileges before doing so. </li>
 <li> The <a href="s6-tcpserver.html">s6-tcpserver</a> program does
exactly this. It implements
a full TCP/IP super-server by building a command line starting with
s6-tcpserver-socketbinder and ending with s6-tcpserverd followed by the
application program, and executing into it. </li>
 <li> For s6-tcpserver-socketbinder, <tt>::</tt> means "all IPv6 addresses",
and <tt>0.0.0.0</tt> means "all IPv4 addresses". It does not provide a way
to bind a socket to all addresses regardless of protocol; instead, you
should use two sockets, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6. </li>
</ul>
