<h1> The <tt>s6-sntpclock</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-sntpclock</tt> is a small SNTP client. It connects to a
SNTP or NTP server, computes an estimated discrepancy between the
local clock time and the absolute time given by the server, and
outputs it on stdout.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-sntpclock [ -f ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -r <em>roundtrips</em> ] [ -t <em>triptimeout</em> ] [ -h <em>throttle</em> ] [ -T <em>totaltimeout</em> ] [ -e <em>errmax</em> ] [ -p <em>port</em> ] <em>ipaddress</em> | s6-clockview
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-sntpclock exchanges SNTPv4 messages with a SNTP server
listening on <em>ipaddress</em>, UDP port 123.
<em>ipaddress</em> can be IPv4 or IPv6. </li>
 <li> It computes the mean difference between the absolute time
given by the system clock and the one given by the server. </li>
 <li> It prints the difference to stdout in a format understood
by <a href="s6-clockadd.html">s6-clockadd</a> and
<a href="s6-clockview.html">s6-clockview</a>. It then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-f</tt>&nbsp;: force. Normally, s6-sntpclock exits 111 if it cannot
compute a time with a smaller uncertainty than <em>errmax</em>. If this
option is set, it will output a time difference and exit 0 even if the
error is too big. </li>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: be more or less verbose.
By default, <em>verbosity</em> is 1. 0 means only print fatal error
messages; 3 means trace every exchange with the server. </li>
 <li> <tt>-r&nbsp;<em>roundtrips</em></tt>&nbsp;: perform <em>roundtrips</em>
exchanges with the server. By default, <em>roundtrip</em> is 10. A lower
value yields a higher time uncertainty; a higher value puts more load on
the server. </li>
 <li> <tt>-t&nbsp;<em>triptimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if a SNTP exchange with
the server takes more than <em>triptimeout</em> milliseconds, abort this
exchange and move on to the next one. By default, <em>triptimeout</em>
is 2000. </li>
 <li> <tt>-h&nbsp;<em>throttle</em></tt>&nbsp;: wait <em>throttle</em>
milliseconds between exchanges with the server. A lower value gets the
final result earlier, but exerts more load on the server. A higher
value puts a lighter load on the server, but delays the computation.
By default, <em>throttle</em> is 0. It is recommended to set it to a
reasonable nonzero value when increasing <em>roundtrips</em>. </li>
 <li> <tt>-T&nbsp;<em>totaltimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if the whole
operation takes more than <em>totaltimeout</em> milliseconds, abort
and exit 1. By default, <em>totaltimeout</em> is 10000. </li>
 <li> <tt>-e&nbsp;<em>errmax</em></tt>&nbsp;: accept a maximum time
uncertainty of <em>errmax</em> milliseconds. By default, <em>errmax</em>
is 100. </li>
 <li> <tt>-p&nbsp;<em>port</em></tt>&nbsp;: contact a server on port
<em>port</em>. By default, <em>port</em> is 123. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> There are a lot of infelicities in the NTP protocol (which SNTP is
a subset of). The biggest offender is probably that NTP cannot handle
a time difference of more than 34 years: if the time given by the NTP
server is more than 34 years away from the time given by the system clock,
then NTP just cannot compute. This is a problem for CMOS-less systems,
where the system clock is initialized to the Unix Epoch. The solution
is to first manually initialize the system clock with a program such as
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/date.html">date</a> or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-portable-utils/s6-clock.html">s6-clock</a>
to a closer time (such as 2013-01-01, which will be good up to 2047), then
contact the NTP server. </li>
 <li> A less obvious problem with NTP is that it works with UTC time,
which means that it gives inaccurate results when close to a leap second,
up to one second off when used during a leap second, and this
is bound to the use of UTC: there is nothing you can do about it. The
only solution to get reliable results even around a leap second is to
use linear time such as TAI; the
<a href="s6-taiclock.html">s6-taiclock</a> and
<a href="s6-taiclockd.html">s6-taiclockd</a> programs provide tools to
do so. </li>
</ul>

<h2> A word on ntpd </h2>

<p>
 From a Unix software engineering standpoint, the well-known
<a href="https://doc.ntp.org/4.1.0/ntpd.htm">ntpd</a> program is an
eldritch abomination. The main reason for it is that, just like its
lovely cousin <a href="https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/">BIND</a>,
ntpd performs a lot of different tasks in a unique process, instead
of separating what could, and should, be separated. This is confusing
for both the programmer <em>and</em> the software user.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> The term "NTP server" means two different things:
 <ul>
  <li> A program that serves NTP time to the Internet and can be
accessed by NTP clients. </li>
  <li> A daemon, i.e. a long-lived process, that runs on a machine
and handles NTP-related stuff such as keeping the system clock accurate. </li>
 </ul>
 The former is the real meaning of "NTP server". The latter is a common
usage for the term, but comes from a misuse of "server" to mean "daemon".
ntpd does not help clear the misunderstanding since it does both. It acts
as an NTP server, <em>and</em> as an NTP client getting its time from
lower-strata NTP servers, <em>and</em> as a local system clock management
daemon. Those are already 3 separate tasks. </li>
 <li> Local system clock management itself involves several duties. There
is the regular setting of the system clock, which can be done with
a loop over a simple program such as <a href="s6-clockadd.html">s6-clockadd</a>.
There is also control of the clock skew, which s6-networking does not
provide because there is no portable interface for that; there is such a tool
in the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/clockspeed.html">clockspeed</a> package. </li>
 <li> ntpd includes a complete cryptographic key management system for the
crypto part of NTP. NTP is not the only protocol that uses cryptography
and asymmetric keys; managing keys in a separate tool, not in the NTP
daemon itself, would be simpler and smarter. </li>
 <li> ntpd provides monitoring support for client and server timekeeping
performance. This would be best implemented as a separate specific log
analyzing tool. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 And of course, no matter how many layers of complexity you add onto
ntpd, it will never be able to give accurate time in the vicinity of a
leap second, since the very <em>protocol</em> is flawed by design - but
the ntpd authors cannot be blamed for that. Also, the ntpd
<em>writers</em>, not the designers, should be praised: the history of
ntpd security flaws is remarkably small, which is quite a feat for a
huge monolithic root daemon.
</p>

<p>
 Network synchronization is important, NTP has its perks and
valid use cases, and its existence is a good thing. However, I wish that
the main NTP implementation weren't written as a big fat clumsy process
running as root. s6-sntpclock together with
<a href="s6-clockadd.html">s6-clockadd</a> aims to provide a small, simple
tool to keep system clocks, especially in embedded devices, synchronized
to a NTP server.
