<h1> The <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> is a program that establishes a TLS or SSL
server connection over an existing TCP connection, then
communicates with an existing local program over already
established pipes. It is the only server-side program in
s6-networking that performs cryptography.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="index.html">s6-networking</a> does not include
cryptographic software. All the crypto used in <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt>
is provided by the chosen SSL backend:
<a href="https://bearssl.org/">BearSSL</a> or
<a href="https://www.libressl.org/">LibreSSL</a>, depending on
the options given when configuring s6-networking.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-tlsd-io [ -S | -s ] [ -Y | -y ] [ -v <em>verbosity</em> ] [ -K kimeout ] [ -d notif ] [ -- ] <em>fdr</em> <em>fdw</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-tlsd-io expects to have an open connection it
can talk to on its standard input and output. It also expects to read
cleartext data from file descriptor <em>fdr</em> and write cleartext
data to file descriptor <em>fdw</em>. </li>
 <li> It expects a TLS client on the other side of the network connection
to initiate a TLS handshake, and it answers it. </li>
 <li> Then it acts as a full duplex tunnel, decrypting and transmitting
data from stdin to <em>fdw</em>, and encrypting and transmitting data
from <em>fdr</em> to stdout. </li>
 <li> When it cannot transmit any more data from/to the local application
because connections have closed, <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> exits. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Exit codes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> 0: the connection terminated normally.
 <li> 96: error while configuring the TLS context - for instance, invalid private key or server certificate files. </li>
 <li> 97: error while setting up the TLS server engine. </li>
 <li> 98: TLS error while running the engine. </li>
 <li> 100: wrong usage. </li>
 <li> 111: system call failed. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Protocol version and parameters </h2>

<p>
 During the TLS/SSL handshake, <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> tries the
versions of the protocol that is supported by default by the
backend, with the default algorithms and cipher suites;
the backend normally ensures that the most secure combination
is tried first, with slow degradation until the client and
the server agree.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> For BearSSL, this means use of the
<a href="https://bearssl.org/apidoc/bearssl__ssl_8h.html#a76293c81c4624c58254a62be7b2d5e79">br_ssl_server_init_full_rsa()</a> or
<a href="https://bearssl.org/apidoc/bearssl__ssl_8h.html#a592b2af27b2f6b9389aac854fb0b783a">br_ssl_server_init_full_ec()</a>
function. The supported protocol versions are described
<a href="https://bearssl.org/support.html#supported-versions">here</a>. </li>
 <li> For LibreSSL, this means use of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man3/tls_config_set_protocols.3">tls_config_set_protocols(TLS_PROTOCOLS_DEFAULT)</a>
call. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 As a server, <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> can be conservative in its
choice of protocols. It is currently not very conservative
when using the BearSSL backend; it could become more so in
the future, by defining a custom server profile that supports
only TLS-1.2 but with several algorithms and cipher suites.
</p>

<h2> Environment variables </h2>

<p>
 <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> expects to have the following
environment variables set:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>KEYFILE</tt>: a path to the file
containing the server's private key, DER- or PEM-encoded. </li>
 <li> <tt>CERTFILE</tt>: a path to the file
containing the server's certificate, DER- or PEM-encoded.
If PEM-encoded, the file can actually contain a chain
of certificates. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 If one of those variables is unset, <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt>
will refuse to run.
</p>

<p>
 If you are using client certificates, <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt>
also requires either one of the following variables to be set:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>CADIR</tt>: a directory where trust anchors
(i.e. root or intermediate CA certificates) can be found,
one per file, DER- or PEM-encoded. </li>
 <li> <tt>CAFILE</tt>: a file containing the whole set
of trust anchors, PEM-encoded. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 If <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> is run as root, it can also read two
more environment variables, <tt>TLS_UID</tt> and <tt>TLS_GID</tt>,
which contain a numeric uid and a numeric gid; <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt>
then drops its root privileges to this uid/gid after reading its
private key file. This ensures that the engine, including the
handshake, is run with as little privilege as possible.
</p>

<h2> SSL close handling </h2>

<p>
 If the local application initiates the end of the session by sending
EOF to <em>fdr</em>, there are two ways for the TLS layer to handle it.
</p>

<ul>
 <li> It can send a <tt>close_notify</tt> alert, and wait for
an acknowledgement from the peer, at which point the connection
is closed. The advantage of this setup is that it is secure
even when the application protocol is not auto-terminated, i.e.
when it does not know when its data stops. Old protocols such
as HTTP-0.9 are in this case. The drawback of this setup is
that it breaks full-duplex: once a peer has sent the
<tt>close_notify</tt>, it must discard all the incoming
records that are not a <tt>close_notify</tt> from the
other peer. So if a client sends EOF while it is still
receiving data from the server, the connection closes
immediately and the data can be truncated. </li>
 <li> It can simply transmit the EOF, shutting down
half the TCP connection, and wait for the EOF back.
The advantage of this setup is that it maintains
full-duplex: a client can send EOF after its initial
request, and still receive a complete answer from the
server. The drawback is that it is insecure when the application
protocol is not auto-terminated. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Nowadays (2020), most protocols are auto-terminated, so
it is not dangerous anymore to use EOF tranmission, and that
is the default for <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt>. Nevertheless, by
using the <tt>-S</tt> option, you can
force it to use the <tt>close_notify</tt> method if your
application requires it to be secure.
</p>

<h2> <tt>s6-tlsd-io</tt> options </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>-v&nbsp;<em>verbosity</em></tt>&nbsp;: Be more or less
verbose. Default for <em>verbosity</em> is 1. 0 is quiet, 2 is
verbose, more than 2 is debug output. This option currently has
no effect. </li>
 <li> <tt>-S</tt>&nbsp;: send a <tt>close_notify</tt> alert
and break the connection when receiving a local EOF. </li>
 <li> <tt>-s</tt>&nbsp;: transmit EOF by half-closing the TCP
connection without using <tt>close_notify</tt>. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-Y</tt>&nbsp;: Do not send a client certificate. This is the default. </li>
 <li> <tt>-y</tt>&nbsp;: Send a client certificate. </li>
 <li> <tt>-K&nbsp;<em>kimeout</em></tt>&nbsp;: if the peer fails
to send data for <em>kimeout</em> milliseconds during the handshake,
close the connection. The default is 0, which means infinite timeout
(never kill the connection). </li>
 <li> <tt>-d&nbsp;<em>notif</em></tt>&nbsp;: handshake notification.
<em>notif</em> must be a file descriptor open for writing. When the
TLS handshake has completed, some data (terminated by two null
characters) will be sent to file descriptor <em>notif</em>. The
data contains information about the TLS parameters of the connection;
its exact contents are left unspecified, but there's at least
an <tt>SSL_PROTOCOL=<em>protocol</em></tt> string and
an <tt>SSL_CIPHER=<em>cipher</em></tt> string, both
null-terminated.
Sending this data serves a dual purpose: telling the <em>notif</em>
reader that the handshake has completed, and providing it with some
basic information about the connection. If this option is not given,
no such notification is performed. </li>
</ul>
